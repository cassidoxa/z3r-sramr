The Rust crate has two functions that return hashmaps: read_stats and
read_equipment. 

The python library's parse_sram function will return a dict
with three sub-dicts: meta, stats, and equipment typed into an appropriate
python type. Fractions and times will be a string, binary equipment such as
the Fire Rod will be a boolean. Equipment such as swords will either be None
or a string indicating which sword the player has. Simple numbers will be
integers.
